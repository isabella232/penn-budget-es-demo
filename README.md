# Penn Budget ES Demo

## Overview

Simple example for how to access ElasticSearch from Python

## Getting Setup

You'll need to create a Python virtual environment using Python 3.6+.  I specifically built/tested this using Python 3.7.3 but should be fine
with anything 3.6 or higher.

Once your virtualenv is created and activated install the dependencies:

```shell
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
